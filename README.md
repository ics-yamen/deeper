        # DEEP (Extended Release)

DEEP is an open source intelligent web-based platform offering a suite of collaborative tools tailored towards humanitarian crisis responses. It includes common analysis workflows and frameworks for thinking using both structured and unstructured, quantitative and qualitative data.

This repository contains code for DEEP 2.0, a large full-stack rewrite of 
DEEP 1.0.

DEEP's brain is powered by DEEPL, an suite of tools to provide NLP
recommendations to the platform. Its code can be found
